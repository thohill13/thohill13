- 👋 Hi, I’m @thohill13
- 👀 I’m interested in mapping, drone photography, and learning new things to do with these machines, which are amazing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... from the beginning. I am new to this, and I am specifically learning how to advance my personal map-making projects in different directions. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to do with making maps and sharing geographical information with my community in a sleek, easy-to-use way.
