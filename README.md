- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @thohill13
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in mapping, drone photography, and learning new things to do with these machines, which are amazing.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... from the beginning. I am new to this, and I am specifically learning how to advance my personal map-making projects in different directions. 
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything to do with making maps and sharing geographical information with my community in a sleek, easy-to-use way.
